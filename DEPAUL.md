2. For video support, install the ChromatikGST plugin at https://github.com/tracyscott/chromatikgst
3. ChromatikGST includes an example Java Processing Sketch for rendering a 4x468 video that can be played on the Wabash fixture.  It relies on ffmpeg being installed and available in your path to generate the lossless video from a series of saved frames.
